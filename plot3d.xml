        <shortdescription>Quickly inspect data for RFI by plotting time vs frequency vs amplitude.</shortdescription>
        <description>
		
		This program is designed to retain peak amplitudes of RFI
		spikes while performing data compression to speed up plotting.
		Your MS remains read-only throughout this program.
		
		If your data contains multiple scans, gaps between scans will
		be reset to 5 integration timescales.

		Version 1.1 (tested with CASA Version 4.2.1)
		4 August 2014
		
		
		Code available at: http://github.com/chrishales/plot3d
		PLOT3D is released under a BSD 3-Clause Licence; refer
		to the header in task_plot3d.py for details.
		
		
		THIS TASK ASSUMES THE FOLLOWING:
		* The end channel of each spw has been flagged. This
		  will make the plots look nicer (you should be flagging
		  these channels anyway).
		* The integration time is constant throughout the MS.
		* The first timestamp in each scan has been flagged (you
		  should be quacking these anyway).
		* When plotall=T, each spw has the same number of channels.
		* Any differences in amplitudes between strong and weak
		  baselines for your target are smaller than the typical
		  RFI spikes you are interested in finding. This program
		  will select the maximum amplitude on any baseline for
		  a given time stamp. This is unlikely to be an issue,
		  as it would require that peak RFI amplitudes on your
		  weakest baseline are smaller than typical amplitudes
		  on your strongest baseline, which would require an
		  amazing (unrealistic?) dynamic range in amplitude vs
		  uvdistance. If you are unsure, plot amplitude vs
		  uvdistance for your target.

----- Detailed description of keyword arguments -----


       Keyword arguments:
       
       Most arguments are self explanatory. Some are a bit quirky, but
       that's how things are done here in the southwest (or maybe that's
       just me). Get in, take a look, and get out. No bells and whistles.

       timecomp -- Number of timestamps to compress. For values N>1,
                   this program will combine N integration cycles and
		   store their maximum amplitude. Increasing N will
		   make plot manipulation faster.
       
       chancomp -- Number of channels to compress. For values M>1,
                   this program will combine M channels and store
		   their maximum amplitude. Increasing M will make
		   plot manipulation faster.
